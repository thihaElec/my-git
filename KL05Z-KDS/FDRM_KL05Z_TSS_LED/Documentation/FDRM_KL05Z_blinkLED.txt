Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "LEDR"      (component LED)
   - LEDR_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LEDR_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDR_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDR_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDR_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDR_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDR_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDR_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "LEDG"      (component LED)
   - LEDG_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LEDG_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDG_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDG_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDG_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDG_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDG_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDG_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "LEDB"      (component LED)
   - LEDB_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LEDB_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDB_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDB_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDB_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDB_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDB_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDB_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "TSS1"      (component TSS_Library)
   - TSS1_Configure -Whole TSS initialization and configuration of registers. Contains main TSS_Init() function, TSS System 
                Config registers and all Control Config registers initialization according to setting of Component properties. 
                The user have to place this function into the proper location in the source code.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL05Z32LC4)
